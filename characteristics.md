# Characteristics

Instead of purely adhering to principles, we're looking for certain characteristics of a system and its
codebase. Sure, some of these characteristics can be found described in principles.

## The Why

The reason we look for a certain set of characteristics is that we want to put ourselves into the pit
of success to be able to create a maintainable system and at the same time be able to be agile and
deliver business value in a timely fashion.

## CUPID

As a response to whether or not the [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) are outdated, Dan North
came up with an alternative acronym [CUPID](https://dannorth.net/2021/03/16/cupid-the-back-story/).
The purpose of this is to describe characteristics one should favor in a system rather than principles
of how to do something. Recommend listening to Dan explain the background and his conclusions [here](https://dotnetrocks.com/?show=1745).
