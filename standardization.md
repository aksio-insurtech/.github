# Standardization

The goal of having a somewhat consistent codebase that is standardized is to avoid being completely
dependent on individuals and make it easier to let the teams have a global ownership.
In a dynamic world were people changes jobs often, the code has to live beyond each individual.
It helps mitigate risks and by being consistent; anyone can pick up any code.
